## Decision Memory

Before proposing architecture, tooling, style, testing, repo structure, or workflow changes in any project:

1. Check for a `docs/decisions/` directory in the project root.
2. If it exists, search it for relevant ADRs (Architecture Decision Records).
3. Treat accepted ADRs as binding unless explicitly overridden by the user.
4. If a decision is outdated, propose a new ADR that supersedes it rather than silently ignoring.
5. Do not re-litigate accepted decisions unless new constraints are introduced.

When creating new ADRs, use this format:

```markdown
# Decision: [Title]

Status: [proposed|accepted|deprecated|superseded]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Context
[Why this decision is needed]

## Decision
[What was decided]

## Consequences
[Trade-offs and implications]

## Supersedes
[Reference to previous ADR, or "None"]
```
